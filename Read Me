To run the server,
run node server.js

The server is being hosted at localhost://3000.

It returns a JSON Object at its homepage i.e (localhost://3000/)

If that doesn't not work, then you might need to install all the dependencies. The dependencies can be installed as:
npm install express hbs --save
